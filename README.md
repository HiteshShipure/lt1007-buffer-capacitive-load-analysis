# lt1007-buffer-capacitive-load-analysis
This repository contains comprehensive LTspice simulations and detailed analysis of a unity-gain op-amp buffer (LT1007) driving capacitive loads of 100 pF and 10 nF. It covers key analog behavior including stability, compensation via series resistors, slew rate, bandwidth, noise, and output swing limits.
